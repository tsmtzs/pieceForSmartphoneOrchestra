# Piece for Smartphone Orchestra

## Introduction

*Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* is a musical work for any number of players.
It is a manifestation of a *systems* approach to music making. Form is a dynamic structure that depends on the interactions and choices of the
performers. A [text score](score/pieceForSmartphoneOrchestra.pdf) directs the actions of the players. Also, by means of a graphic shape, it offers
a vague idea about the form of the piece. The duration of the performance is indeterminate.

Each player uses a smartphone to control a software synthesizer. The interface includes three buttons. It utilizes smartphone sensors to map
device rotation angles to amplitude and frequency deviation. Each button starts/stops a tone. Tone frequencies center around
`1244.507 Hz`, `2489.014 Hz` and `3733.521 Hz`. Rotation of the device modifies the frequency of each button to an interval with
radius `100 cents` around the center frequency. The piece may be perceived as a potential aural game on *beat tones* and
*otoacoustic emission effects*[^kendall-et-al]. It is an attempt to create with very little material, a varying iridescent soundscape.

Ideas that relate to *systems science* and were influnential to
*Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* should be traced in the writings of Horacio Vaggione[^vaggione1][^vaggione2] and Agostino
DiScipio[^discipio1][^discipio2]. Also, in the same vein should be regarded work that builds upon *artificial swarms*
[^blackwell][^blackwell-bentley][^blackwell-young] and *artificial ecosystems*[^bown-cormack][^cormack][^eldridge-bown].
These authors reify the concept of a *system* to a computer simulation or a computational process.
As such, most of the elements of the *system*
and the interactions among them can be defined and manipulated by computer algorithms. In *Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* the interacting
elements are the performers. In order to steer the performance towards an aesthetic goal we choose to shape the interactions
between the performers and the performers with the environment by using text and graphics. Our approach is similar to the text scores
of Pauline Oliveros[^oliveros]. The players react to the global sound and act according to the directions given in text.

We assume that the interpretation of the
[score](score/pieceForSmartphoneOrchestra.pdf)
activates a network of *mental spaces* to each performer. According to Fauconnier "*mental spaces are very partial assemblies constructed
as we think and talk for purposes of local understanding and action*"[^fauconnier]. They are connected to each other and are being modified
during the rehearsals and performances of the piece. This web of *mental spaces* represents an abstract idea about the form of
*Piece for Smartphone Orchestra*.

## Complex systems

*Systems science* is an umbrella term for the study of aggregations of interacting elements. It encompasses ideas and methodologies
from *dynamical systems*, *cybernetics* and *chaos theory*.
A *complex system* is "*one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a nonsimple way*"[^simon].
Holland[^holland1] refers to these interacting elements as *agents*.
Localized interactions among the agents may lead to aggregate patterns of behaviour. This phenomenon is called *emergence*[^miller-page1].

We are interested in complex systems where the agents
adapt their behaviour based on experience. Such systems are called *complex adaptive systems*.
Levin[^levin] defines a complex adaptive system by three properties:
(1) diversity and individuality of the agents,
(2) localized interactions among them, and
(3) an autonomous process that uses the outcomes of those interactions to select a subset of the agents for replication or enhancement.

## *Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* as a complex system

The agents of the system are the performers of the piece. The *state* of each agent is defined by a web of mental spaces.
These form and modify during the rehearsals and the performances of the piece. The [text score](score/pieceForSmartphoneOrchestra.pdf)
offers the clues to construct the *internal model*[^holland2] of the agent.

The complex system of *Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* should be regarded as a process that starts with the rehearsals. Agents interact by
means of communication. Communication is a strategic phenomenon in the sense that shapes agent's anticipation, action and
reaction[^miller-page2]. It encompasses sound, gestures and any related conversation between the players
during the preparation of the piece.
Closely related is the system property of *flows*[^holland3]. This is an
evolving web of interactions that "*reflects changing adaptions as time elapses and experience accumulates*"[^holland4].

Siegenfeld and Bar-Yam[^siegenfeld-yam] regard the complexity of a system to depend on the number of possible behaviours that the system
can exhibit. Behaviour depends on scale. We are interested in the acoustic behaviour of the system during a performance.
For scale we assume *spatial scale*.

On one end there is the whole performance space. At this level *Piece for Smartphone Orchestra* appears
as an arc-like structure that unfolds during the evolution of the piece. Tones, beats and (possible) auditory distortion products come and
disappear as frequencies, frequency deviations and amplitudes follow the arc-like structure.
These beats and auditory distorion products can be viewed as global emergent properties of the system.

At the other end we have the space around an individual agent.
At this level, behaviour is set by the directions in the [score](score/pieceForSmartphoneOrchestra.pdf).
This could be a single sine tone or silence.

Between these two extremes we can define potential areas inside the performance space were certain sounds can only be heared. They are not
fixed and may overlap. These *localities of sound* depend on the distance between the agents, the amplitudes and frequencies of
the playing tones, as well as, the direction or the movements of the players. Localities of sound may encompass single tones, beats or even
auditory distortion products. They should be regarded as local emergent properties of the system.

The last few paragraphs suggest a multi-scale approach to the sound structure of the piece. Different scales are interdependent and form the input
information of the agents. This information is different for each agent. Taken together with player's action form a *feedback loop*.
