** DONE Fix h1 header size in instrument.html
   H1 header /Piece for Smartphone Orchestra/ renders smaller in /instrument than in /index
   or /directions. (mobile chrome)

** TODO Style <a> elements
   Links between pages of the website appear very old-fashioned. Style them using responsive design?
   Add a drop down menu when screen size is small? ...

** TODO Use different colors?
   Take into account that the screen will be seen from the audience, the performance might take place
   in a concert hall possibly with dim lights.

** TODO Use some more advanced typography?
   Choose the right typeface(s). Use different fonts for paragraphs, headers, anchor elements...

** TODO Make a nice web app icon
